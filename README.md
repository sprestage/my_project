Minitest project
=====

This is a minimal rails app created while learning how to use BDD with MiniSpec.

Use BDD to create a ruby class with an instance variable containing a welcome message.

Create a test to browse to google and test the web search functionality.

Output a welcome message via HTML and then test for it's presence on the page.
